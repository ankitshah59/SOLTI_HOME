# HoMart - "Smart Kitchen App/Tech" 
## ( Developer: Ankit Shah )

HoMart is a smart kitchen assistant Android App that can notify the amount of groceries in home, auto/manually update items on cart, show weekly consumption analysis and control kitchen appliances from anywhere online. In our busy life sometimes its very difficult to keep track of groceries and when we go for shopping we might forget to buy some items. There are many things around in the kitchen that might have expired or is nearing expiry that we might not notice. So HoMart app lets you know how much groceries you have based upon the weight of the groceries. 

The HoMart app communicates in real time with the "Smart Kitchen Device" that senses the weight of groceries and tracks the changes in weight everyday and sends the data to the app. User can set the threshold to notify when the groceries are low, ( ie: if there is 7.5lbs Apples and if the user sets the threshold 3lbs then user will be notified when the grocery is low updating the shopping cart). Also having the capability to remind user to check if certain food is expired or not (ie: if the user sets the expiry date to be 4 days of the grocery then the user will be notified on 4th day onwards about the item) by detecting the weight change in the user defined time period.

App also graphs the weekly consumption of each groceries so it will let users know the pattern of their diet, consumption status and items they rarely use. So, next time when they go for shoppping it will help them to "Shop Smart".

Imagine waking up with the coffee ready in the moring when we go to the kitchen, yes HoMart has the feature to control kictchen applicances and set timers when to switch on/off the device from anywhere online. Also, if you forget to turn off the kitchen applicances or lights now you can switch it off from anywhere if you are not home. 

App also has voice recognition feature, so you can just press mic icon and say " Add milk and bread " and the groceries milk and bread will be added to the shopping wish list. Also, you can manually add/remove the items from the wish list.

HoMart is a complete package to assist users of the kitchen.
